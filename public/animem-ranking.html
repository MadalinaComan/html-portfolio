<h1>Best Animu for me</h1>

<h2>Top 3 from all the time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>1. Ghost in the Shell</h3>
<p>Never getting bored of this, my all time favorite.</p>

<h3>2. Black Jack (OVAs)</h3>
<p>Gritty anime movie series, it has drama with a supernatural touch.</p>

<h3>3. Shinsekai Yori</h3>
<p>That moment when you realize humans are assholes to themselves.</p>
